Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project - Zomato Dataset

Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Zomato dataset, which contains information about restaurants, their ratings, cuisines, locations, and sales data. The analysis aims to derive insights that can support strategic decision-making for restaurant owners, marketers, and stakeholders in the food industry.

Goals of the Project

Explore the Zomato Dataset: Understand the structure and contents of the dataset using Pandas.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data quality for accurate analysis.
Feature Engineering: Create new features that can provide additional insights into customer behavior and restaurant performance.
Data Visualization: Use various plot types to visualize data distributions, trends, and relationships between variables.
Summarize Key Findings: Present insights that can aid in business decision-making, such as identifying popular cuisines, regional *performance, and customer preferences.

Technologies Used
The following libraries were used for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization:


NumPy: For numerical computations and handling arrays.
Pandas: For data analysis and manipulation, including data cleaning and transformation.
Matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
Seaborn: For statistical data visualization, providing a high-level interface for drawing attractive graphics.
Word Clouds: Customizable You can customize the appearance of word clouds, including colors, fonts, and shapes.
